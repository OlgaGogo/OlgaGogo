### About me
I enjoy travel, snowboarding, hiking, biking, and learning new skills. I have recently decided to change career paths and began studying QA testing and I am loving it! QA testing suits me very well as I am detail-oriented, enjoy working with data and technology, and enjoy having a positive impact on projects to make them better.
